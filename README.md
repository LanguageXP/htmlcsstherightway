### Translations

Project is very new. You can fork and start translating.

To avoid fragmentation and reader confusion, please choose one of these options:

1. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with `[username].github.com/htmlcsstherightway`
2. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with a subdomain (e.g. "fr.htmlcsstherightway.com")

If you use a subdomain, enter the subdomain into the `CNAME` file, and ask us to setup DNS for you. If you do not use a subdomain, remove the `CNAME` file entirely else your fork will not build when pushed.

When your translation is ready, open an issue on the Issue Tracker to let us know.
