# Welcome

There's a lot of obsolete information about HTML and CSS and how to do websites, many are outdated, whereas 
other more current are either too deep into technicalities or just in need to be found.

Using the thme "the right way" this site is an open-source reference 
which follows the "fork", "pull request" contribution model popular on GitHub.

This site is a user-contributed (and reviewed) documentation 
describing web development best-practices, based on two goals:

1. Vulgarize concepts to teach newcomers
2. Link to other resources to deepen the knowledge

The target audience is people who wants to learn (or re-learn) with today's
HTML+CSS+Javascript best practices to build a web that is future proof.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information and examples as they become available.
