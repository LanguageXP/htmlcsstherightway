# Welcome

There's a lot of obsolete and wrong information about HTML and CSS and how to do websites. 

This is a collection of everything a frontend developer should know regarding best practices 
and guidelines. 

It is meant for complete newbie to learn what is the result of other's experience 
"the right way", or should we say, the way we would had liked it to be at first.

Because the web changed so much, we should not propagate mistakes from the past.
