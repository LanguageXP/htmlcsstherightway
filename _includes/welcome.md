There's a lot of obsolete and wrong information about HTML and CSS and how to do websites. Of course there is also a lot about how to do it too.

This is a collection of everything a frontend developer should know regarding best practices and guidelines. It is meant for complete newbie learn what is the result of other's experience and learn "the right way". Because the web changed so much, we should not do the same past mistakes again.
